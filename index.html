          You just clicked a button. You clicked it almost automatically,
          without much thought behind it. Perhaps you thought to yourself,
          "Ooooh, that's a nice button", or "ooh, a button, I like buttons". But
          did you consider its complexity past its simplicity? Did you consider
          that this mere button was able to transport you across planes of
          technology? I couldn't have made that button a few months ago. Think
          about that for a moment.
          <br /><br />Perhaps you took for granted the power the button had.

          When using an event listener in Javascript, often the "click" of a
          button can trigger a whole domino effect of actions in whatever
          application you are building.<br /><br />I aim to be a metaphorical
          version of this "click" as I become a software engineer. I aim to not
          only showcase my own beautiful complexity, but to also empower those
          around me who have been taken for granted for too long in this
          male-dominated technical field. There is no shortage of success and
          opportunity in the field of technology. This opportunity does exist
          for women, but a challenge I am finding is the difficulty to recognize
          powerful female role-models in higher-up positions. If women, and
          those who identify as women, are meant to climb this ladder, it is
          more difficult to do so when we can not envision ourselves in these
          powerful positions. <br /><br />There is no reason why we can't ALL
          succeed. I plan to share the message that ANYONE, especially young
          women can have a successful career in coding if they want to. I plan
          to spread the message that there IS room at the top for women by
          climbing to the top myself and making space. I want to be a role-model
          for young women. I want girls to see themselves in me- someone who
          learned a set of new skills and practiced her confidence daily. While
          I am climbing this ladder, I will bring women up with me. I am
          determined to host free coding courses to guide young women's minds
          into a future they can clearly see themselves thriving in... an
          opportunity that was never presesnted to me until my 30s.

          As a girl, my mother always gave me the opportunity to voice my
          opinions, to share my thoughts, and I felt valued and heard. I carried
          this confidence with me throughout my schooling, and into a few jobs
          as a young adult. As I became successful, and the time came to move up
          the ladder at each company I was with, I found myself not being taken
          seriously as a player in the game. There became no more room for
          growth. Why could I not climb this ladder? I felt trapped and could
          see no way to get out of a pattern of poverty I was familiar with. My
          confidence began to diminish. I found myself constantly asking myself
          the same question. Could there be a future where one did not have to
          work 2 jobs, 80 hours per week just to make enough gas money to drive
          to work again? <br /><br />
          When I attended a "Try Coding" course at Turing, I proved to myself
          that I could do something so new, so out-of-the-ordinary from my
          beaten-path, that I could begin to see that my future could be shaped
          in a different way. <br /><br />That day, I made a button. I made a
          button from NOTHING, and I felt on top of the world, and it finally
          all clicked... literally. <br /><br />

          I acknowledge the incredible impact that powerful female pioneers such
          as Joan Clark have had on womens short technological history. My own
          personal mentors -both women- decided to make a better future for
          themselves and the world around them by studying at Turing to become
          developers. These women have been real-life examples of what is
          possible for themselves, their loved ones, their community, and for
          their fields. They have never ceased to encourage me to continue
          striving for a better future for myself while continuing to build
          theirs.
          <br /><br />These women have inspired me to ensure that my own "click"
          is heard and that my domino effect spreads kindness, empathy, equity,
          accessibility, and empowers women into more careers, especially
          leadership roles in tech.
