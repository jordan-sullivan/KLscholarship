          You just clicked a button. You clicked it almost automatically,
          without much thought behind it. Perhaps you thought to yourself,
          "Ooooh, that's a nice button", or "ooh, a button, I like buttons". But
          did you consider its complexity past its simplicity? Did you consider
          that this mere button was able to transport you across planes of
          technology and and transport you to an entirely different technical
          dimension to this page? Think about that for a moment.
          <br /><br />Perhaps you took for granted the power the button had.

          With an event listener in Javascript, often the "click" of a button
          can trigger a whole domino effect of actions in an application.<br /><br />I
          aim to be a metaphorical version of this "click" as I become a
          software engineer. I aim to not only showcase my own beautiful
          complexity, but to also empower those around me who have been taken
          for granted for too long in this male-dominated technical field.
          <br /><br />I acknowledge the powerful female pioneers such as Joan
          Clark, and my own personal mentors-both women who decided to make a
          better future for themselves and the wprld around them by studying at
          Turing to become developers. These women have been real-life examples
          of what is possible for themselves, for their comminuty, for their
          fields, and have never ceased to encourage me to continue striving for
          a better future. I will follow in their footsteps to ensure that my
          own "click" is heard and that my domino effect spreads kindness,
          empathy, accessibility and empowers women into more leadership roles
          in tech.
